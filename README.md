# Responsive-F1-Club
---
## Project Goal 

In this project for **CodeCademy Full-Stack Engineer Course**, I’ll be building my own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of any screen!​

---

## Requirements

1. In this project, I’ll build a webpage for a local club. I can base it on real-life organization I belong to or make one up! I’ll get to choose everything about my page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that I want to use, and more! 

2. My project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I've learned such as em and rem, in CSS to size and position page elements; also incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:​

- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
- Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
